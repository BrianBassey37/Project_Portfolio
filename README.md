ABOUT REPOSITORY
This repository comprises projects that I worked on during the Project Phase of my Data Analytics Training and Apprenticeship at Azubi Africa. Each link directs you to a distinct repository housing the files related to the respective project.
NOTE: All the projects and accompanying files were previously located in this same repo. After careful thought and consideration, I decided to create new repo for each project. This will make sure that this repo only acts as a directory page to other repos that contain the different projects. That explains why the newly created project repos have less commits.
