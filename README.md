## Project Overview
The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and data visualization. Key tasks include handling missing values, converting data types, and analyzing trends over the years. The analysis covers sectors, funding stages, and geographical distribution.

## Key Tasks
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Importing necessary libraries.
   - Reading CSV files containing startup funding data from 2018 to 2021.
   - Cleaning data by handling missing values, converting data types, and addressing encoding issues.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Exploring and visualizing the data to gain insights.
   - Creating summary statistics and plots to understand funding trends over the years.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creating new columns or modifying existing ones based on project requirements.

4. **Data Transformation:**
   - Transforming data, such as converting currency values or dealing with exponential values.

5. **Data Analysis:**
   - Analyzing the funding trends, identifying top sectors, and understanding funding patterns across different years.

6. **Visualization:**
   - Creating visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent key findings.
